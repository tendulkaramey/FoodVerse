# FoodVerse: Explore, Order, Enjoy

The project is about handling a really big database for a very popular product at scale. Exploring and learning Database internals to optimize performance.

## Project Brief

At FoodVerse, we assist folks in discovering nearby restaurant menus and offer the convenience to order food straight to their doorstep through our app.<br>

With a large number of restaurants on board, along with ordering and rating service in place (for this POC) we expect our database to be huge. We'll delve deep into database internals to understand how they work and explore ways to optimize their performance.<br>

This is a POC (proof of concept) project aimed to learn and implement system design concepts from real life problem statements.
